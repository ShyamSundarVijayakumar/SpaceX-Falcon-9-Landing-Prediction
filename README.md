### Course Context
This repository contains the capstone project for the **"Applied Data Science Capstone"** course offered by **IBM on Coursera**. It represents the culmination of all concepts learned throughout the specialization, applying the **complete data science lifecycle** to a real-world business problem.

### Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning solution that **predicts whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land**. This prediction helps inform **strategic bidding decisions** for a competing startup in the commercial space launch industry.

### Skills & Concepts Applied
This project demonstrates the full breadth of the data science pipeline, including:

- **End-to-End Data Pipeline Management**: From API-based data collection to structured wrangling and cleaning.
- **Advanced Visualization Techniques**: Crafting both **static and interactive** visualizations to extract and present insights.
- **Machine Learning Model Development**: Designing, training, and evaluating multiple classifiers to predict landing success.
- **Business Communication**: Translating data findings into actionable insights for stakeholders in a real-world context.

### Project Phases & Contents
Each phase is represented by a Jupyter Notebook file:

1. **Data Collection**  
   ðŸ“„ `Lab_1_Data_Collection.ipynb`

5. **Interactive Dashboard Development**  
   ðŸ“„ `Lab_5_Interactive_Dashboard.ipynb`  
   - Building a **Dash web application** for interactive data exploration

6. **Machine Learning Model Development**  
   ðŸ“„ `Lab_6_Model_Development.ipynb`  
   - Training and tuning Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN models

7. **Model Evaluation & Reporting**  
   ðŸ“„ `Lab_7_Model_Evaluation_and_Reporting.ipynb`  
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score
   - Recommending the best-performing model and reporting findings
